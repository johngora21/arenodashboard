# 🤖 AI Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up ChatGPT integration for your Areno Logistics system. The AI assistant provides intelligent insights for shipment analysis, customer support, report generation, and route optimization.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to "API Keys" section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (you'll need it for the next step)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create or update your `.env.local` file in the admin-dashboard directory:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Configure model settings
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=1000
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd admin-dashboard
npm install openai
```

### 4. Test the Integration
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3002/ai-assistant`
3. Try the AI chat interface

## 🎯 Features

### Customer Support
- **Purpose**: Generate professional customer responses
- **Use Case**: Handle customer inquiries, provide service information
- **Example Query**: "Help me respond to a customer complaint about delayed delivery"

### Report Generation
- **Purpose**: Create detailed business reports
- **Use Case**: Generate executive summaries, performance reports
- **Example Query**: "Generate a monthly performance report for our logistics operations"

### Route Optimization
- **Purpose**: Suggest route improvements and cost reductions
- **Use Case**: Optimize delivery routes, reduce fuel costs
- **Example Query**: "Analyze our current routes and suggest optimizations"

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Model Settings
You can customize the AI behavior by modifying the service:

```typescript
// In lib/ai-service.ts
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4", // or "gpt-3.5-turbo" for cost savings
  messages: [...],
  max_tokens: 1000, // Adjust based on your needs
  temperature: 0.3, // Lower = more focused, Higher = more creative
});
```

### Cost Optimization
- Use `gpt-3.5-turbo` instead of `gpt-4` for cost savings
- Reduce `max_tokens` for shorter responses
- Implement rate limiting for high-traffic scenarios

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All API calls are made server-side
- No sensitive data is stored in client-side code
- Consider implementing data anonymization for sensitive information

### Rate Limiting
```typescript
// Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
const rateLimit = {
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
};
```

### API Key Security
- Never expose your API key in client-side code
- Use environment variables for all API keys
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity

## 📊 Usage Monitoring

### Track API Usage
```typescript
// Add logging to monitor usage
console.log(`AI API Call - Type: ${type}, Tokens: ${completion.usage?.total_tokens}`);
```

### Cost Tracking
- Monitor your OpenAI usage dashboard
- Set up billing alerts
- Track costs per feature/endpoint

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Features

### Reports Page
The AI can enhance your existing reports by:
- Generating executive summaries
- Providing insights on performance data
- Suggesting improvements based on trends

### Shipments Page
AI can help with:
- Analyzing shipment patterns
- Identifying potential delays
- Optimizing resource allocation

### Customer Support

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**
   ```
   Error: Invalid API key
   Solution: Check your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
   ```

2. **Rate Limit Exceeded**
   ```
   Error: Rate limit exceeded
   Solution: Implement rate limiting or upgrade your OpenAI plan
   ```

3. **Model Not Available**
   ```
   Error: Model not found
   Solution: Check if you have access to the specified model
   ```

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging:
```typescript
// Add to your AI service
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log('AI Request:', { type, data, context });
  console.log('AI Response:', result);
}
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Caching
Implement caching for common queries:
```typescript
const cache = new Map();
const cacheKey = `${type}-${JSON.stringify(data)}`;
if (cache.has(cacheKey)) {
  return cache.get(cacheKey);
}
```

### Batch Processing
For multiple requests, consider batching:
```typescript
// Process multiple queries in one API call
const batchPrompts = queries.map(q => ({ role: 'user', content: q }));
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Custom Prompts
Modify prompts in `lib/ai-service.ts` to match your business needs:

```typescript
const customPrompt = `
  You are an expert logistics analyst for Areno Logistics.
  Company Context: ${companyContext}
  User Query: ${userQuery}
  
  Provide insights specific to our operations...
`;
```

### Brand Voice
Adjust the AI's tone to match your brand:
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `
  You are a professional logistics assistant for Areno Logistics.
  Always maintain a helpful, professional tone.
  Use industry-specific terminology appropriately.
`;
```
